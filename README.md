proof of why 2+2=4

axioms:
1. These natural numbers exist in sequential order: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...

definitions:
1. addition: x + y expresses the xth successor after y
2. successor: x is the successor of y if and only if x = y + 1

proof of 2 + 2 = 4:
- 2 is the successor of 1, so 1+1=2
- 4 is the successor of 3, so 3+1=4
- 3 is the successor of 2, so 2+1=3
-by substitution,
-2+1+1=4
-Combined with the fact that 1+1=2, we substitute again to get
-2+2=4
-done
